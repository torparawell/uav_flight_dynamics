# UAV Simulation Project

This project simulates the physics and movement of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The components of the project are:
- **uav.py:** Handles the UAV's movement, updating its velocity based on factors like gravity, lift, and drag.
- **simulate.py:** Contains tools for visualizing the UAV's trajectory and saving the trajectory data to a CSV file.
- **run_simulation.py:** Central script to run the full UAV simulation.
- **environment.py:** Defines environmental factors like air density, wind speed, and gravity.
- **control_systems.py:** Manages the control systems of the UAV (details not provided).
- **aerodynamics.py:** Deals with aerodynamic properties and calculations related to the UAV's flight.

**How to Run:**
- Run run_simulation.py to execute the simulation and visualize the UAV's trajectory.
